# statistical_shm
Dynamic identification and structural health monitoring of real structures using statistical time series analysis. Project as part of the taught [Dynamic identification and SHM] at the University of Patras.

## The systems

## Dynamic identification
The developed force sensory system (FSS) is based on strain gauge-sensing and targeted for the fabric gripper that is presented in:

* PN Koustoumpardis, S Smyrnis, NA Aspragathos, [A 3-Finger Robotic Gripper for Grasping Fabrics Based on Cams-Followers Mechanism], International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria Danube Region, 2017

The measurement chain of the FSS consists of:

* 4 strain gauges 350 Ohm Tokyo Instruments FLAB-3-350-11-1LJB-F
* 2 custom half Wheatstone bridges (custom made with 350 Ohm resistors)
* A Load Cell/Wheatstone Shield Amplifier bought by [Robotshop.com]. The shield is equipped with an AD8426 amplifier from Analog Devices that achieves gain up to 1000.
* A Nucleo F334R8 microcontroller.

The sensing principle of the FSS is shown below:

All components are installed onboard a small mobile robot which is equipped with a esp8266 Wi-Fi module for wireless communication with a laptop.

## Structural health monitoring
The FSS presente above was used for cooperative fabric transportation by two wheeled mobile robot in a leader-follower formation. Only the follower is equipped with the FSS and used the provided fabric force feedback to follow the leader.

The force control system of the follower is comprised of two parallel PID controllers.

## Running the code

* The onboard Nucleo MCU accepts code in C++ and can be programmed through the [mbed online compiler] while in cabled connection with the laptop. The MCU keeps the code that was last passed and runs it every time you switch it on or press the reset button.
* The Wifi communication between laptop and robot as well as the force control scheme is implemented in Python.
* To read the data from the FSS with the robot not moving and connected through usb cable with the laptop, you have to pass the code of `src/mbed/Static_experiments_Nucleo.txt` to the MCU throught the online compiler.
* For the wireless force control experiments (connection through Wi-Fi) the procedure is:
  - Pass the code at `src/mbed/Control experiments_Nucleo_follower.txt` and `src/mbed/Control experiments_Nucleo_leader.txt` to the follower and leader robots, respectively. Remember the follower is equipped with the FSS.
  - Run the code `src/wifi_communication/server.py` on the laptop
  - Switch-on or reset the robots.
  - To succesfully connect the robots with the laptop their IPs should be properly configured in the above files.
